# Eat This  

Eat this is a simple application that provides minimalist, wholesome, and nourishing meal plans based on the users input on various parameters like:  
    <> goal macro split (carbs, proteins, fats)  
    <> target calories (or target weight in a number of days)  
    <> ingredient dislikes and preferences  
    <> cost  

All the services that Eat This plans to provide will be completely achievable by the end user with commonly accessible information, the value-add comes from the speed that the optimal solution(s) are arrived at. Not everyone wants to spend a month or two really nailing down a meal plan that will truly support them, and just to change it when your life inevitably exceeds expectations.
